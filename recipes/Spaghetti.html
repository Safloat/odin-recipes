    <h1>Spaghetti Bolognese</h1>
    <img src="spaghettibolog.jfif">
    <p>Everyone needs a great everyday Spaghetti Bolognese recipe, and this is mine! The Bolognese Sauce is rich, thick and has beautiful depth of flavour. It’s perfect for a quick midweek meal but even better if you can simmer it for a couple of hours! Serve it over pasta, stuff into jacket potatoes, make an epic Lasagna or Baked Spaghetti Pie!</p>
    <h2><b>Ingredients</b></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves , <i>minced</i></li>
        <li>1 onion , <i>finely chopped (brown, yellow or white)</i></li>
        <li>1 lb / 500g beef mince (ground beef)</li>
        <li>2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
        <li>800g / 28 oz can crushed tomato <i>(or tomato passata)</i></li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tsp white sugar , <i>if needed</i></li>
        <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme <i>(or 1/2 tsp dried thyme or oregano)</i></li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>400 g / 13 oz spaghetti <i> dried</i> </li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese <i>and finely chopped parsley (optional)</i>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2><b>Method</b></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. 
        Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden
         and softened.</li>
        <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook,
             breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
        <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes (no lid), 
            adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>Slow simmer option: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 – 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so.
              Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce.</li>
        <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti.</li>
    </ol>
